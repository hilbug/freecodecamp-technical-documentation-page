                        <p>This document will walk you through creating a basic fan page for a TV show using Bootstrap
                            5. The fan page
                            will consist of:
                        <ul>
                            <li>Navigation bar</li>
                            <li>Hero Section</li>
                            <li>Character bios</li>
                            <li>Extra reading</li>
                            <li>YouTube video</li>
                        </ul>
                        </p>
                        <p>Bootstrap 5 is a CSS framework which allows you to create mobile responsive websites. It has
                            many built-in components with lots of classes to choose from. It is built upon Flexbox
                            Utilities for easy positioning. A bootstrap page consists of rows and columns. The page will
                            have one container made up of rows and each row contains 12 columns.
                        </p>
                        <p>To get started, two CDN links should be added to your html. First, add the CDN link for
                            Bootstrap in the head tag BEFORE your local CSS stylesheet:
                        </p>
                        <pre><code class="language-html" data-lang="html">&lt;link href="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.0.0-beta3/dist/css/bootstrap.min.css" rel="stylesheet" integrity="sha384-eOJMYsd53ii+scO/bJGFsiCZc+5NDVN2yr8+0RDqr0Ql0h+rP48ckxlpbzKgwra6" crossorigin="anonymous"&gt;</code></pre>

                        <p class="pt-2">Next, add the CDN link for Bootstrap's JavaScript bundle at the <em>end</em> of
                            the body:
                        </p>
                        <pre><code class="language-html" data-lang="html">&lt;script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.0.0-beta3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js" integrity="sha384-JEW9xMcG8R+pH31jmWH6WWP0WintQrMb4s7ZOdauHnUtxwoG2vI5DkLtS3qm9Ekf" crossorigin="anonymous"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
                        </code></pre>

                        <p class="pt-2">Finally, let's create the container and the first row and column in the
                            <span class="span-code">&lt;body&gt;</span> for the navigation bar and hero section:
                        </p>
                        <pre>
                            <code class="language-html" data-lang="html">
                                &lt;div class="container"&gt;
                                    &lt;div class="row"&gt;
                                        &lt;div class="col-12"&gt;
                                            <span class="span-code-note">Navigation and Hero section will go inside here</span>
                                        &lt;/div&gt;
                                    &lt;/div&gt;
                                &lt;/div&gt;
                            </code>
                        </pre>

                        <p>Flux capacitor. I think we need a rematch. My name's Lorraine, Lorraine Baines. David, watch
                            your
                            mouth. You come here and kiss your mother before you go, come here. Hey I'm talking to you,

                        <p>What's a rerun? No, no, George, look, it's just an act, right? Okay, so 9:00 you're strolling
                            through the parking lot, you see us struggling in the car, you walk up, you open the door
                            and
                            you say, your line, George. Jesus. Alright, c'mon, I think we're safe. Watch this. Not me,
                            the
                            car, the car. My calculations are correct, when this baby hits eighty-eight miles per hour,
                            your
                            gonna see some serious shit. Watch this, watch this. Ha, what did I tell you, eighty-eight
                            miles
                            per hour. The temporal displacement occurred at exactly 1:20 a.m. and zero seconds.</p>

                            scared.
                            Um, yeah, I'm on my way. Yeah, who are you? Huh?

                        <p>Huh? Okay, alright, I'll prove it to you. Look at my driver's license, expires 1987. Look at
                            my
                            birthday, for crying out load I haven't even been born yet. And, look at this picture, my
                            brother, my sister, and me. Look at the sweatshirt, Doc, class of 1984. Hey, Doc, we better
                            back
                            up, we don't have enough roads to get up to 88. I need fuel. Go ahead, quick, get in the
                            car.
                            I'm telling the truth, Doc, you gotta believe me.</p>
